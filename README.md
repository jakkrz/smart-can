# Smart Can

*This project was created for a science competition in 2023 as part of a larger IOT project and was developed independently by me during my robotics course at school.*

The Smart Can is a trash can that is mounted on wheels and can open its lid automatically. It is controlled by bluetooth signals sent from a phone through the use of a mobile app.
